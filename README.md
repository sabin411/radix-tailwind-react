# React Project with Tailwind and Radix UI

This project is a React-based demonstration of how to integrate Tailwind CSS and Radix UI to create high-quality design systems and web applications. Radix UI provides unstyled, accessible components, while Tailwind CSS is used to style and customize these components according to our design requirements.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/sabin411/radix-tailwind-react]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [/radix-ui-proj]`
3. Install the dependencies: npm install

### Usage

The project consists of two pages that showcase the usage of Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS styling. Below are the URLs for accessing these pages:

- http://localhost:5173/accordion: This page demonstrates the usage of the accordion component provided by Radix UI. The accordion component allows you to create expandable and collapsible sections of content.
